# MayLeetCodeChallenge
Solutions to the LeetCode 30-day challenge in May 2020

Solutions will include only function stubs, unless otherwise mentioned.

Unless otherwise mentioned, **n** is the length of the array / string in consideration

Problem | Concepts/Algorithms Used | Complexity | Solution
---     |   ---  | --- | --- |
1| Binary Search| O(log n) | [S01](Solutions/S01.cpp) |
2| Substring, Sorting| O(n log n) | [S02](Solutions/S02.cpp) |
3| String Representation| O(n) | [S03](Solutions/S03.cpp) |
4| Bit Manipulation| O(b) (b -> Number of bits) | [S04](Solutions/S04.cpp) |
5| Hash Map | O(n) (Amortized, assuming `unordered_map` is O(1) | [S05](Solutions/S05.cpp) |
6| Arrays, Voting Algorithms | O(n) | [S06](Solutions/S06.cpp) |
